            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>“Between two products equal in price, function and quality…..the better looking will outsell the other.”</h1><p>For anybody involved in selling property, whether an agent or private vendor (owner), getting full market value or more is the prime goal. Of course there is much competition but in recent years this has been compounded by the rise in popularity of property portals such asRightmove,Zooplaand now,On The Market. Today’s property buyers can quickly scroll through nearly all available properties and in just a few clicks, have them listed in the order they choose. This is great for the buyer but increased competition is making it harder for the seller and in many cases, sellers or agents working on their behalf, will make price reduction after price reduction to get more people to look closer and better understand the value of their offering.</p></article>]]></description>
