description: Your most expensive asset should never be put on the market with a few snapshots taken by an Estate Agent who just wants to sell your home for a little as they can get away with. Most of the properties listed on Rightmove and Zoopla have terrible photos which is why your marketing photos need to really shine and stand out from the crowd. Property portal websites are simply online supermarkets for property. Just think how much time and effort goes into making the best selling products more appealing.
